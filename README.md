# Ruby Package

This system brings strict, ES Module style encapsulation to Ruby using [`Ruby::Box`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/4.0/Ruby/Box.html) (requires Ruby 4.0+). Every file is evaluated in a completely isolated namespace, preventing constant leaks and global namespace pollution.

## Exporting (`export`)

The `export` method exposes objects, methods, or values from the isolated box to the outside world. It has two modes: Single Export and Multiple Exports.

### Single Export

If a file represents exactly one concept (like a class or a single function), export that object directly.

```ruby
# user.rb
class User
  def initialize(name) = @name = name
end

export User
```

### Multiple Exports (Named Exports)

If a file acts as a collection of utilities, pass a Hash (via keyword arguments) to `export`.

```ruby
# math.rb
def add(a, b) = a + b

export(
  PI: 3.14159,
  version: "1.0.0",
  add: method(:add)
)
```

## Importing (`import`, `import_relative`)

There are two methods available globally to load these isolated files:

- `import(path)`: Resolves the path using Ruby's native `$LOAD_PATH` or gem lookup. Ideal for gems and libraries.
- `import_relative(path)`: Resolves the path relative to the directory of the file calling it (exactly like `require_relative`). Ideal for local project files.

`import` / `import_relative` always returns one of these:
- a default export object (single export),
- a `Package::Exports` instance for named/hash exports (`Package::Exports < Module`),
- or a `Package::Box` instance when the target has no explicit export.

### The Single Import

If the target file used a Single Export, `import` / `import_relative` returns that exact object.

```ruby
Customer = import_relative 'user'

alice = Customer.new("Alice")
```

### The Namespace Import

If the target file exported multiple items via a Hash, the import returns a `Package::Exports` instance containing those exports. You can assign it to a constant to act as a namespace.

- Exported keys starting with a **Capital** letter become Constants on the module.
- Exported keys starting with a **lowercase** letter become singleton methods on the module.

```ruby
MathUtils = import_relative 'math'

# Accessing a constant
puts MathUtils::PI        # => 3.14159

# Accessing values and methods (both act as singleton methods)
puts MathUtils.version    # => "1.0.0"
puts MathUtils.add(5, 5)  # => 10
```

### The Destructuring Import (Pattern Matching)

Instead of assigning the entire namespace to a constant, you can use Ruby's rightward assignment (`=>`) pattern matching to pluck exactly what you need.

```ruby
import_relative('math') => { add:, version: }

puts add.(5, 5) # => 10
puts version    # => "1.0.0"
```

Rename an import with an alias:

```ruby
import_relative('math') => { add: sum }
puts sum.(10, 10) # => 20
```

### Importing Constants

Ruby's pattern matching enforces that local variable names must start with a lowercase letter. This creates a gotcha when trying to extract exported Constants using destructuring. Here are the recommended approaches:

**Option 1: Direct Namespace Access** (recommended for single constant)
```ruby
PI = import_relative('math')::PI

def calculate_area(r)
  PI * (r ** 2)
end
```

**Option 2: Use `fetch()` Method** (clean one-liner)
```ruby
PI = import_relative('math').fetch(:PI)

def calculate_area(r)
  PI * (r ** 2)
end
```

**Option 3: Use `fetch_values()` for Multiple Constants**
```ruby
PI, E = import_relative('math').fetch_values(:PI, :E)

def calculate_area(r)
  PI * (r ** 2)
end
```

**Option 4: Alias and Promote** (pattern matching approach)
```ruby
# 1. Destructure and alias to a lowercase local variable
import_relative('math') => { PI: pi }

# 2. Promote to a Constant in the current file
PI = pi

def calculate_area(r)
  PI * (r ** 2)
end
```

### Importing from Bare Gems/Scripts

If a gem or script file doesn't export anything explicitly (no `export` call), `import` returns the isolated `Package::Box` instance itself (`Package::Box < Ruby::Box`). This allows you to access any constants or methods defined within that gem/script directly through the Box namespace.

```ruby
ChronicBox = import('chronic')
Chronic = ChronicBox::Chronic

puts Chronic.parse('tomorrow 9am')
```

## Per-Package Gem Dependencies

Each package can have its own isolated gem bundle. Set `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` and call `require 'bundler/setup'` at the top of the package's entry file, **before** any `import` calls:

```ruby
# packages/my_package/lib/my_package.rb
ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] = File.expand_path('../gems.rb', __dir__)
require 'bundler/setup'

# Now gems from this package's bundle are on $LOAD_PATH
require 'dotenv'
config = Dotenv.parse(File.expand_path('../.env', __dir__))

# ... rest of package
```

Because every `import` runs in its own `Ruby::Box` with its own isolated `$LOAD_PATH`, each package's gem bundle is completely separate from others — two packages can even use different versions of the same gem.

### How `import` resolves `$LOAD_PATH`

`import` reads `Ruby::Box.current.load_path` at call time and copies non-gem entries into a new `Package::Box` before resolving the target there. This keeps package-local paths available while preventing parent gem load paths from leaking into child import boxes.

## Examples

### Minimal

Four packages (`main`, `foo`, `bar`, `baz`) in a flat directory using `import_relative`. Demonstrates single/hash exports, cross-package dependencies, and destructuring.

```sh
RUBY_BOX=1 ruby examples/minimal/main.rb
```

### Complex

A route-planning demo with three packages in a `packages/` directory using zeitwerk-style naming. Demonstrates single export, hash export, `import`, `import_relative`, destructuring, `fetch`/`fetch_values`, constants, and isolated gem bundles.

- **main**: Uses a local `examples/complex/Gemfile` with a root-only path gem (`root_only_toolkit`).
- **adventure**: Uses `dotenv` (`~> 3.0`), `colorize`, and `chronic` via package-local `gems.rb`.
- **quest**: Pure-Ruby planner package; also checks that root-only gems from `main` do **not** leak into child import boxes.
- **loot**: Uses `dotenv` (`~> 2.0`) via package-local `gems.rb` in a helper subprocess, proving two versions of the same gem can coexist in the example flow.

Each package adds sibling `packages/*/lib` dirs to `$LOAD_PATH` so cross-package imports resolve by name. `main.rb` does the same before calling `import`.

```sh
# Install gems used by the complex example
cd examples/complex && bundle install && cd -
cd examples/complex/packages/adventure && BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gems.rb bundle install && cd -
cd examples/complex/packages/loot && BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gems.rb bundle install && cd -

RUBY_BOX=1 ruby examples/complex/main.rb
```

## Development

```sh
bundle install                        # Install root dependencies
RUBY_BOX=1 bundle exec rake           # Run all tests and examples
bundle exec rake format               # Format codee
```
